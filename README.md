# mPosTracker Version 1.0

Toolbox for tracking and analyzing crowded mixture of colloidal particles

This toolbox aims to help for scientists who work in soft matter physics 
where spherical particle tracking from video data and analyzing the particles trajectories.

For mPosTracker running properly
	mPosTrackerGUI.m
	mPosTracker.m
	PosFinder.m
	icons Folder
should be at the same folder.

For quick start, one can use RUN.m in Matlab Editor.

Example_for_mPosTracker.m, for using mPosTracker by command line (without GUI)

Example_for_Single_Image.m, for using only PosFinder for a single image by command line

singleParticle.mPos, A saved tracking project, one can load it in mPosTrackerGUI. 
For example using singleParticle_avi_1th_kind_1th_Particle.xls, one can see the trajectory of single particle obtained by mPosTracker.
